# Contribution Guide

Everyone can contribute to help other developers utilize this documentation for their learning and to improve their programming skills.

## Naming Convention for filenames

1. **Lowercase Letters**: Use lowercase letters to maintain consistency and avoid issues in case-sensitive file systems.
   - Example: `frontend-engineering.md`

2. **Hyphens for Spaces**: Use hyphens to separate words instead of spaces or underscores. This improves readability and avoids issues with URLs.
   - Example: `learning-and-development.md`

3. **Descriptive Names**: Use descriptive names that clearly indicate the content of the file.
   - Example: `introduction-to-css.md`

4. **Avoid Special Characters**: Avoid using special characters except for hyphens. This prevents potential issues with different operating systems.
   - Example: `setup-guide.md`

5. **Versioning**: If versioning is necessary, include the version number at the end of the file name.
   - Example: `api-documentation-v1.0.md`

6. **Dates**: If including dates, use the ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD) for clarity and sorting purposes.
   - Example: `release-notes-2024-07-06.md`

Following these guidelines, some examples of Markdown file names are:

- `getting-started.md`
- `frontend-best-practices.md`
- `responsive-design.md`
- `javascript-fundamentals.md`
- `css-tips-and-tricks.md`
